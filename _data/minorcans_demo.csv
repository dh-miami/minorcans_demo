The upper floor of Juan Villalonga house on St. George Street (now part of the restored Spanish Quarter in St. Augustine) proved a popular venue for these dances for more than 20 years. Filis and Felipe Edimboro hosted dances there in the 1790s, and although periodic legislation attempted to prohibit late night dances for ""people of color"" in 1813, the government sentenced Villalonga, who by then had become a barrio commissioner, to eight days' house arrest for violating the useless ban.
